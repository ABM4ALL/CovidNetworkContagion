# README

This CovidGridContagion model is built on top of the 
[CovidContagion](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidContagion) 
model to show how the ``Network`` module of **Melodie** can be used.
The code is introduced in this [documentation](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/gallery/covid_network_contagion.html).
However, before diving in, we strongly suggestion you to first go over the [CovidContagion](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidContagion) model 
and the [tutorial](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/tutorial.html) of Melodie with most details.
