# README

This CovidNetworkContagion model [[doc](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/gallery/covid_network_contagion.html)]
is built on top of the [CovidContagion](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidContagion) 
model to show how the ``Network`` module can be implemented.
If you haven't, we will strongly suggest to read the 
[documentation](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/tutorial.html) of the CovidContagion model first.
